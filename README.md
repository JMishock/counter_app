# counter_app

This is a simple counter application.
The top box counts upwards in incriments of one.
The bottom box is a backwards counter that counts backwards (decrements) by one.
Copy in folders to VS or text editor of your choice.

Running the attached code
You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it.
To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first.
Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder).
Run npm start to pull up application on your computer.
Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
